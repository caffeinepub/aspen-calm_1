  "summary": "Build \"Aspen Calm,\" a glassmorphic, responsive iPad patient immersion portal for Aspen Dental Care that provides audio/visual \"digital sedation\" and entertainment tailored by age, anxiety level, mood, and language, with clinical safety controls and staff monitoring for Bose QuietComfort/Ultra headsets.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "UI must be a responsive iPad prototype using a glassmorphic design language; interactions must be single-finger friendly for reclining patients.",
    "Brand palette: Deep Plum #4E345A (primary/buttons), Champagne Gold #D4AF37 (premium + Nurse Help icon), Mist Grey #F5F5F7 (background).",
    "Personalization logic: content and layout should change meaningfully by age group, anxiety level, mood choice, and language.",
    "If anxiety >=7, primary recommendations must be Sonic Shield (brown noise) and Deep Zen (5Hz binaural).",
    "Integrations expected via APIs or web-views: Spotify/Apple Music/YouTube Music for audio; Netflix/Prime/Disney+ Hotstar/YouTube/Kids for video; separate service icons.",
    "Clinical safety requirement: staff-set password-protected master volume cap + prominent one-touch mute/pause interruption.",
    "Staff-only controls should be hidden behind an access mechanism and include Bose headset battery monitoring and subscription/account management.",
    "Do not present sign-in/auth options in the patient-facing prototype UX.",
    "Add Bose QuietComfort Ultra pairing/connection UI using Web Bluetooth API: Bluetooth icon initiates pairing; show real-time connection status in the top bar with an animated \"connecting\" indicator that transitions to \"connected\".",
    "Emergency Talk (Mute & Pause All) control should not appear on the first selection/intake page; it should only be shown/enabled after a user selects playable audio/video content (media-selected/playing context)."

    "Kids-safe section does not successfully open YouTube Kids as intended.",
    "Visual Escapes (Virtual Window, Ocean/Nature) access/playback is unclear or non-functional; should play videos on the iPad.",
    "Regional language Spotify links in Regional Radio & Hits open incorrect pages/playlists; language tiles are not mapped to correct-language content.",
    "Cinema/OTT module options are empty in current build (provider tiles not present or not loading).",
    "Audio Pharmacy module shows \"failed to load\" in current build (module content not loading).",
